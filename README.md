#Baseball Management

This is the front-end repo for a baseball management website. The site allows users to sign up and register themselves as a player. It also allows an administrator to keep track of who has played, determine ages, and more.

##Install

Clone this repo and press `npm install`. 

##Login

To test the app you can login using `testuser` as the user and `password` as the password. `testuser` has administrative privileges and should see all players in the database. Normally a user can only see and view players they've registered.
